This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It frequently happens when dealing with asynchronous operations where the data might not have loaded yet.  For example, if you're fetching data from an API and trying to render it before the fetch completes, you'll encounter this error.

```javascript
// Incorrect code
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text> {/* This will cause the error if data is still null */}
    </View>
  );
};
```
